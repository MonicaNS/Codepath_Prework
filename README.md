# Codepath_Prework
#Hello_World
This is a required "prework" for the android mobile dev of codepath course application.
This simple project includes a textview, a button, and background color change features.
Part of the required work is to talk briefly about myself in this readme file.

I like :food:, :music:, and :driving:.
